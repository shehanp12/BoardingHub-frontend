## Description
- With the corona pandemic, carefulness is highly motivated. The main goal of this project is to
help employees of the Courtaulds, to manage their boarding needs in the pandemic situation.
And this can also be used to manage boarding advertisements and renting houses for
employees easily, effectively and reliably. So, our main objective is to build a mobile application
for employees to select their boarding needs online in a reliable and user-friendly environment.
The employees will be able to select their boarding houses or rooms and boarding houses
owners have the benefit of doing their business to a large group of customers.

- As a team, our solution is to introduce a new platform for Courtaulds company which provides
the above-mentioned services. The main deliverables are a web-based system for the boarding
owners and admins, and mobile app, for employees and owners. Here, this product is a web
and mobile application which connects employees and service providers.
Boarding house owners around the company, can share their advertisement in this section
targeting the employees of the Courtaulds company. This process is a sustainable eco-friendly
process as the need for printed paper advertisements will not be necessary.



#### Technologies

- Flutter
- Ios
- Android
- The system proposed is going to be developed using several technologies. We are going
to use flutter for the front end and node js for backend, ms sql for database and react for
the admin panel. React allows developers to create large web applications that can
change data, without reloading the page.
We will be using mssql as the database because the project is a relational structure which
can easily be mapped by an ER diagram and also, we are not expecting extremely large
amounts of requests per second and also, so it is secured. Here we used node js for
backend. Node js is amazing with ms sql. We can run queries on our database with ease.
There’s a package called mssql that’s available on npm and widely used to execute sql
queries to a database.
